# TMA-API

## the Too Many Acronyms API

This is a (nearly) headless API that returns the meanings of acronyms queried by users.

I built this with Python on the Flask microframework during a day of class where we were encouraged to explore an unfamiliar technology. I spent the morning learning the basics of Python, then I scraped a list of 2500 acronyms from a site and stored them in a .json file. I then moved on to Flask and figured out how to setup a basic server to receive user requests and respond with either HTML or JSON, depending on the query.  

It's hosted on Heroku <a href="https://desolate-woodland-12241.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
